# PathLossModelEstimator

This repository contains the implementation of an algorithm to estimate the path loss exponent, transmitted power, and Gaussian noise variance in a wireless channel using drive test data.

## Description

The PathLossModelEstimator uses field measurements (received signal strength and geographical coordinates) to estimate key parameters of the wireless channel. The parameters estimated are:

- Transmitted Power (P0)
- Path Loss Exponent (beta)
- Gaussian Noise Variance

The estimation is based on a log-distance path loss model and a linear regression method.
